# WatarPool

This is the group project for CS 348 Fall 2022 at University of Waterloo

## Overview

WaterPool is a Web application that provides an affordable carpooling platform in the Ontario region. In WaterPool, drivers can post their availability on the dashboard, so that passengers can choose their best travelling option. On the other side, passengers can post carpool requests so that drivers can contact them directly and schedule the service.
